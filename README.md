# Catalyst Jukebox
A modern jukebox with a focus on social interactions







does it clearly say what your artefact is and why people should care?  
does it include any visual elements? (screenshots, diagrams or videos are great to grab people’s attention)  
does it have links to other important documentation?  


# Setup

## Hardware
![Raspberry Pi 3 B](assets/raspberry-pi-3-b.jpg?raw=true)  
![ESP32 Thing](assets/esp32-thing.jpg?raw=true)  

Here is a list of hardware I have used for this project:
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) for the server and Spotify audio device
* [5 inch touch screen](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/5-Inch-LCD-Touch-Screen-HDMI-Display-800-480-Raspberry-Pi-3-2-eParcel-Sydney/152408334219?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649) for the Raspberry Pi to display QR codes and other information  
*Note: any screen is probably fine, however this is a generic model and as such I don't have a better link, so this is the exact one I used*
* [Sparkfun ESP32 Thing] as the location device *(also referred to as the 'restaurant pager/buzzer')*
